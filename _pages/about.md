I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Málaga. Previously, I worked at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen (2013–2016) and the Center for Electric Power and Energy at the Technical University of Denmark (2011–2013).

I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) in 2011, under the supervision of Prof. Antonio Conejo. My doctoral research, titled "Medium-term electricity trading for risk-averse power producers via stochastic programming," developed stochastic mathematical models to optimize the trading strategies of power producers in electricity derivatives markets. I also hold a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Málaga, obtained in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

My research focuses on power system operation and planning, decision-making under uncertainty, bilevel programming, machine learning, and statistics.
